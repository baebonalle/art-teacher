  <h2> 	What We Do </h2>
  <p>  	The AI Art Teacher is a learning tool that teaches beginner artists how to improve their work with the power of AI. Artists can submit their work and receive feedback, learning how to improve aspects of their art like composition, use of color, perspective, technique, and more. They can also see the advice given by the AI applied to their work. This project uses generative AI chatbots and stable diffusion. The AI Art Teacher provides beginner artists specialized advice at scale, rewarding them with the same benefits as an expensive art class in a matter of seconds. Through this tool, AI can make the process of learning art even more accessible, amplifying untapped artist talent.
